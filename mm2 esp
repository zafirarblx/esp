-- Placeholder for the function that determines a player's role
function getPlayerRole(player)
    -- This function should return the role of the player: "Murderer", "Sheriff", or "Innocent"
    -- You need to implement this based on the game's specific role assignment logic
    -- For example, it might look like this:
    -- if player:FindFirstChild("Role") then
    --     return player.Role.Value
    -- end
    return "Innocent" -- Default to Innocent for this example
end
